# Library-v1.2-Spring-Hibernate-JPA-PostgreSQL
This is the application for library service. It helps with CRUD operations, also has relationships between people and books in library.
With help of Bootstrap and Thymeleaf template engine it has a nice front-end design.
I did it using these technologies:
- Spring (IoC, MVC, Data JPA)
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL 
- Bootstrap 
- Thymeleaf
